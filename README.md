# Speed_Sensor

This Repository contains the complete KiCad project of the speed_sensor PCB design as well as important Datasheets and lots of random files and data relating to the project.

## important directories

- **/Datasheets** -> self explanatory
- **/KiCad** -> complete KiCad project and resulting gerber files for pcb printing.
- /Software -> miscellaneous software created mainly to experiment with certain things. not critical
- rest: unsorted files and folders containing parts-lists/footprints/... (need to be properly sorted)

## possibilities for simplifying the design

- maybe ditch the rechargeable lithium battery and use a small coin battery (CR2032) instead... majorly simplifies the PCB design and reduces friction points... But, rechargeable would be nice... Just something to think about.

## LICENSE

No license because project is properly unfinished :D Whoever would want access, needs to contact me.
