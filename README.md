This Repository contains the complete KiCad project of the speed_sensor PCB design as well as important Datasheets and lots of random files and data relating to the project.

## important directories

- **/Datasheets** -> self explanatory
- **/KiCad** -> complete KiCad project and resulting gerber files for pcb printing.
- /Software -> miscellaneous software created mainly to experiment with certain things. not critical
- rest: unsorted files and folders containing parts-lists/footprints/... (need to be properly sorted)
